The main purpose of the project is to solve the Kaggle's challenge hosted by Airbnb called "Airbnb New User Bookings" in the website  https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data. 

Tool used: R Studio


Due to the performance constraints I have partitioned the training data set into training and test.
The file uploaded in the repository is a .RMD file which has chunks of code as well as its purpose.

3 algorithms are employed including K-nn,Linear Discriminant Analysis and finally the XG Boost.
Logistic regression is simply used to predict whether the users next destination could be found or not and also to evaluate the performance of the model using the Decile-wise lift chart.
